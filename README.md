# nEM
This repository refers to the paper  [Durante, D., Canale, A. and Rigon, T. (2017). *A nested expectation-maximization algorithm for latent class models with covariates* \[arXiv:1705.03864\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03864), where we propose a novel **nested EM** for improved maximum likelihood estimation of **latent class models with covariates**.

The repository contains the source functions `LCA-Covariates-Algorithms.R` for the implementation of the proposed **nested EM**, along with additional algorithms routinely used in the estimation of **latent class models with covariates**.
